      <h2>Covid19 Toolkit</h2>
      <p><strong>Intention: </strong>The United States has the highest number of Covid-19 cases around the world. Itâ€™s been almost half a year since the huge outbreak in the United States but we still see the curve of cases not slowing down. It is critical to educate the public about the basic facts and approaches of prevention to stop further spread of the disease. So we created a Covid-19 Toolkit to help people of all ages learn basic statistics, symptoms, and prevention of Covid-19.</p>

      <h2>System of Managing Food Expiration in Refrigerators</h2>
      <p><strong>Intention: </strong>We all have encountered the problem when we opened our fridge and found something went expired by surprise. With all the fruit, vegetable, dairy products we keep in the fridge and busy school works, it is hard and tiring to keep track of all the expiration dates manually. A lot of food ends up in the dumpster in this way. This not only leads to financial waste for students but also causes a huge waste of food. In order to prevent this major waste, We developed our Frigi-track, to remind people of the freshness of their food.</p>
